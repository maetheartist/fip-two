This week 2 task has to do with understanding of version control system eg git. 
Using basic git commands and also creating a gitHub repo
adding files to the repo
 A repo is also known as a folder stored on github which you can retrieve later.
I forked a repo from https://github.com/Jerryjmk14/Counter-App.git and then cloned it into my local engine.
It is a simple counter app built with html, css and JavaScript that counts to a certain number then prompts users/clients to get the pro version of it.
I deployed the git commands in cloning, creating a branch and fixing some ui changes and responsiveness before pushing it to my repo.
I updated the repo in my local engine.
